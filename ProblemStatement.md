Problem Statement: Campus Placement Scheduler and Resource Hub

Background:
Navigating through the campus placement season can be a daunting task for students. They often struggle with keeping track of various company schedules, understanding different job roles, and accessing relevant preparation materials. A central hub that organizes this information and provides targeted resources can significantly enhance the placement experience for students.

The Challenge:
Create an innovative and user-friendly web application that serves as a comprehensive scheduler and resource hub for campus placements. The application should help students efficiently manage their placement activities and access essential resources in a streamlined manner.

Key Features to Implement:
●	Interactive Placement Calendar: Design a calendar interface where students can view and manage the schedule of upcoming company visits, application deadlines, and interview dates. Include features for personalized reminders and notifications.
●	Company Information Portal: Develop a section where students can access concise profiles of visiting companies, including details about job roles, eligibility criteria, and past placement statistics.
●	Preparation Material Aggregator: Create a platform for sharing and accessing resources like interview experiences, study materials, sample questions, and tips specific to companies or job roles.
●	Quick Query Forum: Implement a forum or chat feature where students can ask questions and receive quick responses, either from peers or from a panel of recently placed alumni.
Objectives:
●	Streamline the placement preparation process for students, reducing anxiety and improving organization.
●	Provide a centralized, easy-to-access platform for all placement-related information and resources.
●	Enhance communication and information sharing among students, alumni, and the placement cell.
Considerations:
●	Prioritize a clean, intuitive user interface to ensure ease of use.
●	Include functionalities that can realistically be developed within a 24-hour time frame.
●	Ensure data privacy and security, especially for personal student information.
This problem statement is designed to be specific, relevant, and solvable within the limited time of a hackathon, focusing on a critical aspect of student life - campus placements. It aims to provide immediate value to students while being an engaging challenge for participants.
